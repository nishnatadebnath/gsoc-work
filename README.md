# Project Title

The Talawa app as we know should support the chat functionality among users as well as the user and the organization.I have been working on the chat functionality as a part of the Github Externship Winter Cohort.The basic features of the chat has and will be implemented by the end of April.While working with the code base ,one of the most major important feature which should be there for any management app is that there should be a persistent ,stable cloud file storage system which will help in sending of files between the users of the app.Besides sending file,the cloud file storage system will also be helping in storing essential multimedia which is also a very essential feature and of high priority This proposal intends to complete the backend API support for multimedia storage and also sending of media over chats. The cloud service we will be implemented using AWS storage.

## Learnings
1) Research is the most important before taking up any project.

2) Personally handled nodeJS code for the first time ,had a great learning curve.

3) Kudos to the mentors for giving me new insights in solving problem.


## Problems faced

1) Dynamic dependencies was one of the most troubling problem which I had to face beside that unseen errors while handling with CI/CD pipelines.
2) Personal problem of lack of time due to academic and placement procedures which provided an overall hindrance to project.
